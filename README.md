## Notes

I encountered challenges when trying to implement some components in the index.js file. It was tricky at first to get everything working together properly, but after spending more time on it, I was able to understand how it should all fit together.

The search bar was another challenge. Adding it to the JavaScript file and making sure it worked well with the rest of the app took some effort, but I eventually figured it out and learned more in the process.
